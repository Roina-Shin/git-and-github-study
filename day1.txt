Git is a version control system.
To use Git, you need to install Git on your system.
Git Bash is a terminal that you can use to work with Git.

1. Set your user name and email
- git config --global user.name "Yejin Shin"

After you run this, check your user name using the following:
git config user.name

- git config --global user.email roinashin@gmail.com

Likewise, check your user email using the following:
git config user.email

2. Basic commands

pwd : to know your present working diretory
touch : create file
rm : delete file
rm -rf : delete folder
('rf' stands for 'recursive force')

3. Repository
- git status
- git init : to create a new git Repository

After you run this, you will see .git folder which is hidden.

3. Commit

Commit is a checkpoint in time in your repository.
It's a series of changes you make in time within a project.

Think of the analogy of tweezers that you use to select ones that you want to make a group for a commit.

There are 3 steps in commit process.

1) Working Directory 2) Staging Area 3) Repository

To move on to Staging Area, we use "git add [file name] [file name2]"
To finalize adding them to repo step, we use "git commit [file name] [file name2]"

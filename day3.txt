Until now, our commit is done in a linear fashion.

But in reality the changes are made in many different ways.

Branching is a signature feature of git.

They allow us to create separate contexts and whatever we do 
in branch won't impact other branches until we decide to 'merge'.

We are still on our master branch.
When you make a new git repository, it automatically becomes a master branch.

Head is a pointer in current location.
At any point, we can create different branches and splinter off into 
different directions.

We can have all these different branch pointers, heads, 
referring to different commits, and switch between them by moving head.

* Branch commands

1) type git branch

2) As we only have master branch, we see *master.

3) To get out of there, type 'q'.

4) make a new branch : git branch [name]

5) switch to another branch : git switch [name]

6) switch back to master : git switch master

7) 'git checkout [name]' does exactly the same thing as 'git switch'

8) create and go straight to the branch : git switch -c [name]


* Merge commands

1) First move over to master branch

2) Use this command : git merge [branch name to be merged to master]
